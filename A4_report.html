    <h2>Proposition: After the 2016 elections, there was a notable increase in abortion clinics in Republican states in comparison to Democratic states. 
	</h2>
	<h3>Motivation and dataset:</h3>
	<p> Primary motivation for this visualization is to show the trend of abortion rates and access to abortion post 2016 elections.  This stems from a pressing need to understand the impact of political changes on reproductive rights and healthcare access. The 2016 elections in the United States marked a significant shift in political ideologies and policies related to reproductive health, including abortion. In addition to the Guttmacher dataset, I have used an external datset of 2016 election results to distinguish between Republican vs. Democratic States. </p>

      <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>

			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>
				




				<li>Chart type [-1]: I chose a stacked bar chart to show the proportion of Republican percentage in comparison to Democratic. This decision was made to visually amplify the perceived influence of Republican states.</li>
				<li>Data transformation [-2]: I intentionally used cumulative data of all states to ignore outliers in order to show the overall influence of Republican states. I considered data of both Republican states and Democratic states in order to solidify the comparative proposition. </li>
				<li>Visual cues [-0.5]: To represent Republican and Democratic states, I used red and blue colors respectively, adhering to standard color conventions. Additionally, I increased the size of the bars to dramatize the effect and visually emphasize the Republican influence.</li>
			    <li>Axis scaling[-0.5]: I deliberately set the axis to start from 0 and end at 40 to highlight the perceived pervasiveness of the Republican influence.</li>
			    <li>Titles and labels[-1]: In the title of the chart, I sensationalized the language by using words like "boom" to attract attention. Moreover, I mentioned the 2016 election in the title to add a political context to the visualization. Additionally, I used the word "increase" in the axis label instead of "change" to impart a stronger impression of growth.
				</li>
			</ul>

      <h3>AGAINST the Proposition</h3>

				<figcaption>
                 Precentage change in the no. of abortion clinics vs. % change in abortion rates in Republican states from 2017-2020. There are strong outliers like Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Missouri. Most of the states lie around X axis or on the negative sides of the axis showing no or negative change in abortion clinics and abortion rates for these states. 
				</figcaption>
			</figure>

			<p>
				Design Decisions and Rationale:
			</p>

			<ul>

				<li>Chart type[2]: I chose a scatter plot to show all the republican states. This was an intentional decision to highlight outliers like Kentucky, Oklahoma, and Missouri. 



 




				<li>Data transformation[1.5]:To provide a comprehensive view of the impact of policy changes in Republican states, I used both % change in the number of abortions and % change in abortion rate. The decision to focus solely on Republican states dataset and not overwhelm the viewer with Democratic analysis was intentional, as the outliers are more prominent within this subset. </li>
				<li>Visual cues[1.5]: I used different colors to represent each state in the scatter plot, aiding in easy identification and comparison. I was initially struggling to decide if I should include all states but since the highlight of this scatter plot was to show that most of the states were in 0 or negative axis meaning there was not much change or even if there was it was negative, I had to choose to show all the states in different colors.  I used acronyms of states to make them visible as annotations in the chart so as to not confuse the readers with just the colors. I used acronyms instead of full forms to avoid wordiness and crowd.</li>
				<li>Axis scaling[2]: Axis scaling is consistent for X and Y axes and in the range of -100 to 120 to cover all data points and maintain uniformity.</li>
				<li>Titles and labels[1]: The title of the chart is intentionally made meaningful to lead the audience to see the points where most of the states were either in 0 axis or on the negative side implying the stringent policies. Although the title is intentionally made persuasive for the readers, it is not totally deceptive. The labels do not just say “increase” but include “change” to show both positive and negative changes.

      <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

      <h3>Reflection choices and ethical analysis:</h3>
	  <p>Reflecting on the design decisions that I made throughout the decision process, it was clear that each decision, from chart type to data transformation, played a crucial role in shaping the persuasiveness of the visualizations. Each decision, however, is not always straight-forward or easy. Especially making a visualization with a preconceived intention in mind requires even more diligence. Despite this, I realized that having a pre-conceived intention does not necessarily equate to unethical design. For instance: in the case of first visualization, knowing what message I wanted to convey before designing the chart made me cherrypick deceptive design tactics to make that argument. Although I was doing the second design with a similar approach of having an argument in mind and then designing the visualization, I was not cherry picking or hiding any truth. My intentions were as earnest as possible. </p>
      <p>What distinguishes a visualization from ethical vs. unethical? This question got answered to an extent while doing this assignment because to me, intention is the key. If I am willing to show everything that I believe to be true even though it means challenging my preconceived belief, it would be an honest motive and thus an ethical design. For instance: people might argue that the title of my second visualization is too persuasive as it is leading the reader towards a certain direction. That is true to an extent but I do not think it is deceptive because as a designer, I have gone through an extensive process of exploratory data analysis and am designing something that I believe to be true. Even if I used design tactics to make my argument of stringent abortion policies in Republican states persuasive, I do not think it would be deceptive. Now the question of whether to make a visualization persuasive or not is simply not worth arguing for me because I do not think neutrality is achievable in these tasks.The goal should be to be persuasive but honest and ethical.  
	</p>
		
		<p>Drawing bounds between “acceptable” persuasive choices vs. “misleading” ones is a complicated task. However, the intent and effort of the designer makes it easier to differentiate.Acceptable persuasive choices are those which enhance the clarity and understanding of the data in a holistic way without distorting or misrepresenting the underlying information. For instance: in my earnest design approach, I did not try to hide the outliers and made the axis uniform for both X and Y axes. In contrast, misleading choices intentionally manipulate or mislead the audience, undermining the integrity and trustworthiness of the visualization. Just like in my first chart where I manipulated the axis, hid the outliers that worked in favor of my argument, and sensationalized the title. This is outright misleading. </p>
		
		<p>The idea of “intention” might lead to a counterargument that how would someone as a reader know the intent of the designer to decide if the visualization is deceptive or not. One way to address this challenge is to focus on the observable characteristics of the visualization itself. While intent may not be directly accessible, the design choices made by the designer are tangible and can provide clues about the potential persuasiveness or deceptive nature of the visualization. For example, readers can examine aspects of the visualization such as the choice of data representation (e.g., chart type), visual encoding (e.g., color, size), labeling, and overall narrative framing to assess its transparency and credibility. Deceptive visualizations may exhibit characteristics such as selective data presentation, misleading labeling or scaling, or biased narrative framing that prioritize a specific interpretation of the data. Although the distinction between ethical vs unethical is a blurry space, there are some standards that can help readers recognize the difference as much as possible. </p>
